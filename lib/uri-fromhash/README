NAME
    URI::FromHash - The fantastic new URI::FromHash!

SYNOPSIS
    Perhaps a little code snippet.

      use URI::FromHash;

      my $foo = URI::FromHash->new;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple functional "named parameters" style
    interface for creating URIs. Underneath the hood it uses "URI.pm",
    though because of the simplified interface it may not support all
    possible options for all types of URIs.

    It was created for the common case where you simply want to have a
    simple interface for creating syntactically correct URIs from known
    components (like a path and query string). Doing this using the native
    "URI.pm" interface is rather tedious, requiring a number of method
    calls, which is particularly ugly when done inside a templating system
    such as Mason or TT2.

FUNCTIONS
    This module provides two functions both of which are *optionally*
    exportable:

    * uri( ... )
    * uri_object( ... )
        Both of these functions accept the same set of parameters, except
        for one additional parameter allowed when calling "uri()".

        The "uri()" function simply returns a string representing a
        canonicalized URI based on the provided parameters. The
        "uri_object()" function returns new a "URI.pm" object based on the
        given parameters.

        These parameters are:

        o scheme
                The URI's scheme. This is optional, and if none is given you
                will create a schemeless URI. This is useful if you want to
                create a URI to a path on the same server (as is commonly
                done in "<a>" tags).

        o host
        o port
        o path
        o username
        o password
        o fragment
                All of these are optional strings which can be used to
                specify that part of the URI.

        o query This should be a hash reference of query parameters. The
                values for each key may be a scalar or array reference. Use
                an array reference to provide multiple values for one key.

        o query_separator
                This option is can *only* be provided when calling "uri()".
                By default, it is a semi-colon (;).
